# MercadoLibre Scraper
A web scraper I'm working on to get data quickly from MercadoLibre.

It currently only works for the "Ropa" category (apparel), but I intend to make it as versatile as possible.

## Instructions
You should be able to run this program on your computer by using Pyinstaller.

`pyinstaller ml.py`

Then, simply run the ml file located inside dist/ml folder.
