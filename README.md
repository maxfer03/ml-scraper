# MercadoLibre Scraper
A web scraper I'm working on to get data quickly from MercadoLibre.

It currently only works for the "Ropa" category (apparell), but I intend on make it as versatile as possible.

## Instructions
Tu run the script:
`python3 ml.py [...]`

You can pass as many arguments as you want, but sentences must have hyphens, not spaces!
E.g.:
```
python3 ml.py remera-verde camisa-manga-corta ....
```
